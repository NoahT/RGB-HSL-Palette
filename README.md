# RGB-HSL-Palette
Library designed to make monochromatic, complementary, or analogous color palettes based off RGB and HSL color spaces.

RGB-HSL Palette is a Java library that uses color theory in order to make color palettes from RGB and HSL color spaces. Given that the JDK
currently lacks support for colors outside of RGB space, this library intends to fill that gap, along with the ability to generate palettes
based off colors in either space.
